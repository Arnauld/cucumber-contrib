Preamble
========

In this Coffe Machine Project, your task is to implement the logic (starting
from a simple class) that translates orders from customers of the coffee
machine to the drink maker. Your code will use the drink maker protocol to
send commands to the drink maker.


**Important !**


You do not have to implement the coffee machine customer interface. For
instance, your code could consume a simple POJO that would represent an
order from a customer.

You do not have to implement the drink maker. It is only a imaginery
engine that will receive messages according to the protocol. Your job
is to build those messages.

Iterations
----------

This project starts simple and will grow in added features through the iterations.


 1. First iteration: Making Drinks (~30 minutes)
 2. Second iteration: Going into business (~20 minutes)
 3. Third iteration: Extra hot (~20 minutes)
 4. Fourth iteration: Making money (~20 minutes)
 5. Fifth iteration: Running out (~20 minutes)


Ready ?


**Requirements**

 * Your favorite IDE or text editor
 * A testing framework (`junit`, `rspec`, ...)
 * A mocking framework (`mockito`, ...)
 * A passion for tested code ;)



An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex. "it's all in
chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }
