Preamble
========

In this Coffe Machine Project, your task is to implement the logic (starting
from a simple class) that translates orders from customers of the coffee
machine to the drink maker. Your code will use the drink maker protocol to
send commands to the drink maker.

**Important !**


> You do not have to implement the coffee machine customer interface. For
> instance, your code could consume a simple POJO that would represent an
> order from a customer.
>
> You do not have to implement the drink maker. It is only a imaginery
> engine that will receive messages according to the protocol. Your job
> is to build those messages.
